HOW TO RUN:
- Open terminal in location of the makefile. Type "make" to generate the executable as well as run the game.

GAME CONTROLS:
- up/down arrow keys: navigate menu buttons
- space: select menu button/shoot projectile
- left/right arrow keys: control ship movement
- key 'p': pause the game
* Instructions on how to play game is also located inside the "How To Play" option.

Advanced Graphical Features implemented:
- Lighting (5%) (Added 2 point lights)
- Textures (10%) (On player ship at the bottom; added proper UV maps)
- Alpha Blending (5%) (On particles, which fade as their lifetime continues)
- Particle Systems (5%) (enemy ship "explosion" upon death)
- Animated characters (5%) (ships/Enemies/projectiles moving)
- Non-geometric primitives (10%) (UI (instructions is an image), including score and health)

BONUS (Your Own Idea Here): .obj Rendering (5-10%) (Player ship. UV's, normals, rendering. Optimized and can handle hundreds of thousands of triangles on a modern machine. Custom models)

Total: 40%

**Difference from project proposal:
Instead of shaders, we have animation and alpha blending as we decided it would better suit our project. Also added .obj bonus.
