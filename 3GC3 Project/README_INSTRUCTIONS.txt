Advanced Graphical Features implemented:

Particle Systems (5%) (Enemy ship "explosion")
Animated characters (5%) (Ships/Enemies/projectiles moving)
Non-geometric primitives (10%) (UI, including score and health)

BONUS (Your Own Idea Here): .obj Rendering (5-10%) (Player ship.  UV's, normals, rendering.  Optimized and can handle hundreds of thousands of triangles on a modern machine.)

**Difference from project proposal:
Instead of shaderes, we have animation and Alpha Blending as we decided it would better suit our project.  Also added .obj bonus.
